				<h1 class="page-header">Learning curve</h1>
                <p> Learning Android was hard at first but at least the language used was Java which we are all familar with.
                That however has also became a hindrance at times since Oracle Java is different from Android Java in someways.
                An example would be some packages in Oracle Java doesn't exist in Android Java.</p>

                <p> Another Problem would be studying how apps in the Android system works. You should know the states of the app
                ( i.e. paused, resumed ) and how the activities interact for you to be effectively create an application.</p>

                <p> We were self taught so at first we felt that we just typed random characters until they compiled </p>

				<h1 class="page-header">Limitation of Resources</h1>
                <p> The lack of a decent default calendar picker in android has been troublesome for us. We wouldn't want to use 
                an external library because if we were to use those packages, then we would have to change the foundations of our
                app which is tedious work.</p>

				<h1 class="page-header">Beta Outside of User Perspective</h1>
                <p> It was scary for us when we were to present our app to beta testers since our UI is not really that good. But 
                at least our base is stable and hardly crashes which I believe is big plus for us. Also the fact the we were able
                to implement some Location Based functionality is for us fine by itself.</p>
